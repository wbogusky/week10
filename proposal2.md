# Wearable Theremin
By using Arduino, a speaker, and two ultrasonic sensors, a lightweight and portable version of the instrument known as the Theremin can be produced.

## Summary
Theremins are electronic instruments which are operated without physical contact from their player. Two antennae, one for pitch and one for volume, control a wave generator which is then amplified by a speaker. By using ultrasonic range sensors, we can take data about the distance between the sensor and an object and translate it into pitch and volume controls. My hope would be to actually attach the sensors to gloves or some other wearable structure to allow users to play the theremin on any object, mobilely.

## Component Parts
- Two ultrasonic range sensors
- Two wearable structures (gloves or straps)
- Arduino and breadboard
- Speaker
- Software synthesizer / tone generator
