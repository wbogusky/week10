Q R Here
QR code stickers and a web app to help BART passengers visualize incoming trains.

Summary
I'd like to take what we learned about API integration to create a tool for BART passengers, particularly those who are unfamiliar with the routes and stations to get a better grip on their location in the BART system. This project will use the BART API to animate incoming trains for a specified station, determined at app launch by a QR code sticker placed on the map at the station.

Component Parts
QR code stickers - Each station will have a dedicated URL from which I'll generate QR codes which can then be printed as stickers
Web app - The URL associated with each station will open to the web app which will animate incoming trains to that station along with minute by minute ETAs
BART API - The information about incoming trains can be collected easily from the API, however I'm not sure how to use that information to animate the train icons yet
