# Glyph Generator
A graphical program designed to quickly generate a set of glyphs based on flexible rules controlled by a user.

## Summary
I'm interested in writing systems. By using p5's drawing functions, I can create a program which generates combinations of marks within a set of possibilites to create a functional set of glyphs to be used in con-scripting or cryptography.

## Component Parts
- p5.js editor program
  - draws a collection of glyphs
  - saves jpgs? saves svg? saves ttf?
- user input
  - control rules / potential strokes
  - maybe include a tool to display text using the glyphs as an alphabet?
