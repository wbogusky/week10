# p5.js Cellular Automaton
Using the p5 web editor to create a pixel based cellular automaton.

## Summary
I have only recently heard of these programs but as I understand them they are grid based simulations of propagation based on simple rules about adjacency. I need to do more research but I think that building one of these using p5.js would be fun and engaging. I'm not sure how feasible this is, but this program would ideally allow users to input values that control the rules determining the program.

## Component Parts
- p5.js editor program
  - draws the cells
- user input
  - determines aspects of each cell's propagation
